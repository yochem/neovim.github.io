  faq:
    - question: What is the project status?
      answer: |
        The current [stable release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest)
        version is `0.11` ([RSS](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tags.atom)).
        See the [roadmap](/roadmap/) for progress and plans.
    - question: Is Neovim trying to turn Vim into an IDE?
      answer: |
        With 30% less source-code than Vim, the [vision](/charter/)
        of Neovim is to enable new applications without compromising Vim's
        traditional roles.
    - question: Will Neovim deprecate Vimscript?
      answer: |
        No. Lua is built-in, but Vimscript is supported with the
        [world's most advanced Vimscript engine](/doc/user/api/#nvim_parse_expression()).
    - question: Which plugins does Neovim support?
      answer: |
        Vim 8.x plugins and
        [much more](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects).

## Features

### Extensible

- API is first-class: [discoverable](/doc/user/api/#api-mapping),
  [versioned](/doc/user/api/#api-contract),
  [documented](/doc/user/api/#api-global).
- [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) structured communication enables
  extensions in any language.
- Remote plugins run as co-processes, safely and asynchronously.
- GUIs, IDEs, web browsers can `--embed` Neovim as an editor or script
  host.
- [Lua plugins](/doc/user/lua/) are easy to create just like
  Vimscript plugins. Your config can live in `init.lua`!
- AST-producing [parsing engine](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) enables
  faster, more accurate syntax highlighting, code navigation,
  refactoring, text objects, and motions.

### Usable

- Strong [defaults](/doc/user/vim_diff/#nvim-defaults) including a
  unique, minimalist colorscheme.
- Builtin [LSP client](/doc/user/lsp/) for semantic code inspection
  and refactoring (go-to definition, "find references", format, ...).
- Client-server architecture allows you to
  [:detach](/doc/user/gui/#%3Adetach) the UI and keep the editor
  session running (like tmux). Attach multiple UIs to any Nvim session.
- No "Press ENTER" messages (Nvim 0.12 feature).
- Works the same everywhere: one build-type, one command.
- Modern terminal features such as cursor styling, focus events,
  bracketed paste.
- Builtin [:terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZbMVj9XSUo) set
  the standard for "TTY as a basic component".

### Drop-in Vim

- Fully compatible with Vim's editing model and Vimscript v1.
- Start with [`:help nvim-from-vim`](/doc/user/nvim/#nvim-from-vim)
  if you already use Vim. If not, try `:Tutor`.
