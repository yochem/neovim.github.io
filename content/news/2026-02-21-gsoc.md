Neovim is participating in [Google Summer of Code 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026/organizations/neovim)!

If you're a student and want to work on Neovim for GSoC, [start here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code).

The next steps are:
1. Read the [guidelines](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code).
2. If you have a project idea or want to take one of the items listed there,
   create a new [discussion](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions) (which you can update over the next days/weeks) with
   a scope outline. Aim for "clarity without verbosity".
3. Start getting familiar with the codebase by working on one or more
   [complexity:low](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acomplexity%3Alow) issues (or any other issue that feels tractable).

Thank you for your interest in Neovim!
